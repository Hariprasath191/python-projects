Perfect mindset 🔥 — finishing *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (ABSP) will give you a **solid Python foundation**. Since you want to complete it fully, here’s a **practical plan** that makes sure you don’t just *read*, but actually *learn + apply*.

---

# 📚 Plan to Complete ABSP

### 🔹 Step 1: Setup

* Install **Python 3.10+** on your system.
* Install **VS Code** or PyCharm (better coding experience).
* Create a folder like `AutomateBoringStuff/` → inside, keep **one script per chapter/project**.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Follow This Weekly Breakdown

*(Assuming \~1 hr/day, you can adjust speed if you’re faster)*

---

### ✅ Week 1 → Python Basics

* **Ch 1–6**: Basics (Flow Control, Functions, Lists, Dictionaries, Strings)

  * Practice every mini-program.
  * At end of Ch 6, you should be comfortable with “small Python puzzles.”

👉 Goal: Write 5–6 tiny scripts (calculator, word counter, simple guessing game).

---

### ✅ Week 2 → Automating Everyday Tasks

* **Ch 7–9**: Files, Organizing Files, Pattern Matching
* Work with your own folders (rename, move, delete files automatically).
* Regex → practice matching emails, phone numbers, dates.

👉 Goal: Automate cleaning your downloads folder 🚀.

---

### ✅ Week 3 → Web & Docs Automation

* **Ch 10–13**: Debugging, Web Scraping, Excel, Word, PDFs
* Install libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `openpyxl`, `python-docx`, `PyPDF2`.
* Scrape a website you actually care about (e.g., cricket scores, weather).

👉 Goal: Write a script to extract info from a site + save into Excel.

---

### ✅ Week 4 → Advanced Automation

* **Ch 14–16**: CSV, JSON, Time, Email & SMS
* Automate reading/writing CSVs (connect to your Google Sheets if possible).
* Send yourself an automated email/text (e.g., daily weather update).

👉 Goal: Build a daily “morning report” bot.

---

### ✅ Week 5 → GUI Automation & Extras

* **Ch 17–20**: Controlling mouse/keyboard, GUI automation, GUI programs (PyAutoGUI, Tkinter basics).
* Try automating something fun: e.g., a bot that opens YouTube, searches a song, and plays it 😆.

👉 Goal: Make 1 GUI project — like a small to-do app or calculator.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Project Phase (Final Week)

* Pick **2 real-life tasks** from your own life:

  * Cleaning files
  * Auto-mail sender
  * Report generator
  * Game bot (like your apple/bird/bomb idea)
* Build & polish them.

👉 By now you’ll have **10–15 useful scripts** ready for GitHub.

---

# 🎯 Rules for Success

1. **Don’t skip coding** → type every example, don’t just read.
2. **Tweak every project** → change inputs, filenames, conditions.
3. **Keep a “Script Diary”** → note what each script does in simple words.
4. **Share on GitHub/LinkedIn** → makes your progress visible.

---

⚡ If you follow this, you’ll finish ABSP in **\~6 weeks** with solid automation skills.

Do you want me to also make a **daily checklist (like Day 1 → Day 2 → etc.)** so you can track your progress step by step?
